☐ Func to reset TEMP[] after execution of current instruction and FLAGS after execution of next instruction
☐ Complete individual opcode funcs handling length of instruction[]
☐ mov instruction r2=FLAGS (only legal use of flag)
☐ mem_addr in ld and st must be var only
☐ mem_addr in jmp and related E instructions must be label only

☐ 255>=imm>=0 
☐ mem_addr = imm = 8-bit
☐ instruction = 16-bit
☐ mem_size = 256
